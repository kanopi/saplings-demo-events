# Saplings - Events Demo Content Recipe

This recipe provides content the Saplings Events recipe.

## How it was created.

We used the Default Content module to export content we created on a local
environment.  The Default Content module should only be used as a `--dev`
module. It is not needed in production.

## Recipe application

### Pantheon
`terminus drush site.env -- ev "passthru('php core/scripts/drupal recipe path/to/recipe');"`

### Drush 13+
`drush recipe path/to/recipe`

### PHP script
`php core/scripts/drupal recipe path/to/recipe`

## Instructions on how to use the Default Content module to create a recipe.

Require the module in dev. We don't need it in production.

`fin composer require --dev 'drupal/default_content:^2.0@alpha'`

Enable the module.

`fin drush en -y default_content`

Export all nodes and dependencies.
`dcer` gets all the dependencies of the entity you are exporting.

`fin drush dcer node --folder=recipes/saplings-content/content`

Export all Menu links.

`fin drush dcer menu_link_content --folder=recipes/saplings-content/content`

Export all taxonomy terms.

`fin drush dcer taxonomy_term --folder=recipes/saplings-content/content`

You can add an ID or bundle to each if you want to pick and choose.

`fin drush dcer menu_link_content 42 --folder=recipes/saplings-content/content`

Disable the module when done.

`fin drush pmu -y default_content`

## Notes

This should not be used as a tool for deployments. Use Workspaces for that.

The IDs on the destination site could differ from those on your dev site.
